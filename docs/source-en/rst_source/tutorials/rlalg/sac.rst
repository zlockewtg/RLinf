Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Algorithm
==================================

1. Introduction
---------------

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is one of the most widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.  
It consists of two key components:

- Actor (Policy Model): generates actions based on the current state.
- Critic (Q-value Model): evaluates the value of current observations and the chosen actions.

Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is an off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control. 
It is based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework, 
which augments the standard reward objective with an entropy term to encourage exploration and robustness. 
SAC simultaneously learns a stochastic policy and two Q-functions, 
using entropy-regularized Bellman backups and automatic temperature tuning. 
Due to its sample efficiency and stability, 
SAC has been widely applied in robotics and continuous control benchmarks. 

For more details, see the original SAC paper 
`SAC <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290>`_.


1. Objective Function
----------------------

Let the policy be :math:`\pi`. Then the Q function for :math:`\pi` is defined as: :math:`Q^{\pi}(s, a)`. In SAC, the Q function satisfies the following soft Bellman equation:

.. math::

   Q^{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim P, a \sim \pi} \left[
      r(s, a) + \gamma (Q^{\pi}(s', a') + H(\pi(\cdot|s')))
   \right]
   = \mathbb{E}_{s' \sim P, a \sim \pi} \left[
      r(s, a) + \gamma (Q^{\pi}(s', a') - \alpha \log \pi(a'|s'))
   \right].

Here :math:`\gamma` is the discount factor, :math:`H` is the entropy of the policy, and :math:`\alpha` is the temperature parameter that determines the relative importance of the entropy term against the reward.

Therefore, the loss for the i-th Q-function :math:`Q_{\phi_{i}}` is as follows:

.. math::

   L(\phi_{i}, D) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s', d) \sim D} \left[
      \frac{1}{2} \left(
         Q_{\phi_{i}}(s, a) - (r + \gamma (1 - d)(\min_{i} Q_{\overline{\phi_{\text{targ}, i}}}(s', a') - \alpha \log \pi_{\theta}(a'|s')))
      \right)^2
   \right],

where :math:`D` is the replay buffer, :math:`\overline{\phi_{\text{targ}, i}}` are the parameters of the target Q-network, and :math:`a'` is sampled from the current policy :math:`\pi_{\theta}`.

The policy :math:`\pi_{\theta}` is to maximize the expected Q value and entropy. Therefore, the policy loss is defined as follows:

.. math::

   L(\theta, D) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim D, a \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[
      \alpha \log \pi_{\theta}(a|s) - \min_{i} Q_{\phi_i}(s, a)
   \right].

In practice, the temperature coefficient :math:`\alpha` is learnable. Then the alpha loss is defined as follows:

.. math::

   L(\alpha, D) = - \alpha (H_{\text{targ}} - H(\pi(\cdot, d))), 

where :math:`H_{\text{targ}}` is a hyperparameter representing the target value for entropy. It is typically set to negative action dimension.
